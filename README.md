## 📘 Project Overview

This project is based on the Adventure Works dataset, which is a company that deals with adventure sports equipment.
It showcases end-to-end BI development, including ETL, data modeling, DAX calculations,
and dashboard creation.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company, wants to better understand its sales performance, product profitability, customer trends, and geographical markets.
Currently, insights are scattered across multiple raw data tables, making it difficult for management to make quick and informed business decisions.

The objective is to build a unified Power BI reporting system that consolidates data and provides high-value insights for strategic planning.

## 🎯 Project Goals 

The goal of this project is to design a complete end-to-end Business Intelligence solution using the AdventureWorks dataset. This includes performing data extraction, cleaning, modeling, KPI development, and building interactive dashboards in Power BI that deliver actionable insights across sales, customers, products, and geography.
This project demonstrates industry-standard BI practices and showcases professional Power BI skills suitable for real-world analytical roles.
